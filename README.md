# Key-Manager-UI

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
This is an UI created to just handle the function of manage passwords.
This is still an exploratory WIP, so it may get some data updates soon.
This UI consumes a Java API (see [Key-Manager-Service](https://github.com/gal16v8d/key-manager-svc)).
UI can anyway go alive through a flag that enable mocking using [MSW](https://mswjs.io/).

## Available Scripts

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
